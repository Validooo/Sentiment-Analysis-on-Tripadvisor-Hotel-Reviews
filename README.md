# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Tripadvisor-Hotel-Reviews

This was my NLP project at the university and it is about doing Sentiment Analysis on Tripadvisor Hotel Reviews. The dataset was taken from <a href= "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/trip-advisor-hotel-reviews">Kaggle </a> and consists of two columns and 20491 rows.

In the Report pdf, we explain our project and everything we did and we present the results. The code is written in the Jupyter Notebook file.
